              Ok so, at the beginning of the year my skin was itchy and thought it must be allergies or perhaps a reaction to ‘the pill’. The doctor thought the same so gave me some cream but the only thing that helped was antihistamine hay fever tablets and clove oil (clove oil is useful to have around). 
              <br/><br/>
              Then in May, I then discovered a small lump (half the size of a golf ball) on my left neck / collarbone area. It wasn’t sore and I felt well. I heard that cancer lumps are not necessarily painful, and you don’t always feel sick unless it’s at an advance stage. 
              Therefore, I knew to take the lump seriously - But

                As I was doctors following up my itching skin, I also mentioned my lump. She explained to me that back lumps are normally superficial but mine is at the front and worth getting an ultrasound and a blood test. The doctor mentioned it could be a cancer or perhaps some sort of other inflammation.

                This marked the beginning of a lengthy diagnoses. Blood test results showed healthy and normal range (lymphoma cannot be detected by blood), ultrasound should a few small clusters of lumps. Next steps were to undergo a CT scan to provide more detail information. CT scan showed clusters on the neck and some around my chest.

                I was then refereed to the Peter Mac Cancer Centre and of course I knew I was in the best hands. At this stage I still felt like I had a 50/50 chance of this not being cancer. The physician explained to me that’s there’s no way of telling for sure until we can an accurate biopsy. He explained to me given the results of the CT scan could be stage 2 lymphoma as it’s all contained in the upper region and that the itchy skin could be a sign of lymphoma (surprise)! He also mentioned the possibility of sarcoidosis – another serious immune condition. 
                <br/><br/>
                Throughout the weeks ahead I underwent numerous checks (and to help rule out other cancers) – nasal and throat assessment, mammogram, ultrasound on thyroid, fine needle biopsy (unable to determent results), a PET scan and the finally a core biopsy. 
                <br/><br/>
                Getting the core biopsy was rather intense experience (but less painful than the dentist in my experience). The doctor took longer than expected as he had to craft his way around my artery and was selective with the sample of tissue taken.

                  Finally come July 21 I was given results on the core biopsy and were able to confirm that I had lymphoma. The next day I saw the haematologist and he was able to inform me of the exact diagnosis

                Even though I knew the outcome would most likely lead to this, it was only till I got this confirmation it then hit me. For four days straight I was shaking and knew that I needed to process my emotions in order to get into a better mind frame.  I wanted to hide away and ideally would’ve loved a small getaway before treatment started – but you know COVID times. I had a lot of good support around me – even though somewhat eery to receive ‘get well’ gifts while feeling ‘well’ – it really did helped feeling loved and supported my ones that mean most to me.

              <ol class="pt-3 font-bold">
                <li>[ABVD] 6 months of treatment<br/>
                  <span class="font-light text-sm">-  with a 90% success rate, a less aggressive treatment (slight chance of radiotherapy)</span>

              </ol>

            <p class="sm:mt-4 leading-loose">
              At first, I thought the less aggressive treatment as I wanted to be less risk of infections, but at the same time liked the idea of being able to complete treatment before the end of year. Either way I was happy to for the group of doctors to have a meeting to discuss my case and get back to me about their opinion.

              I was also given the option of some fertility care – freezing the eggs or an injection to put the ovaries on pause.  I did opt-in for the injection to stop menstrual cycle and to help avoid early menopause (but nothing is guaranteed).              <br/>

              <br/><br/>
              A week later I got my treatment recommendation to go ahead with <strong>BEACOPP & ABVD</strong> <small>(aggressive but shorter option)</small>. I was happy and had complete faith with the doctors recommendations. 
              <br/>
              At least I have shorter treatment to allow me to recover quicker. I had about under 3 weeks to begin treatment.

              During this time, I could focus on my health, I had a lot of great recommendations from family and friends and some of them whom had gone through their own battle with cancer.

                      This was the start of my low week. Hospital emergency stay.
                      <br/>
                      I had a high temperature, and as part of precaution had to go into emergency. I thought I was going to get a quick assessment and be dismissed once no signs of infections were confirmed. Oh boy – was I wrong.
                      As soon as I arrived, I presented my patient card as a quick reference to my condition and so I could be placed into the correct isolated room for my volubility.  Yet, I was missed placed for the first hour or so as I had an awkward blood test taken upright on the bed. The doctor eventually visited and told the nurse off for the error. I was then transferred to an isolated room as I waited for results and had my medical information collected. 
                      <br/>
                      Afterwards I put on the drip to prevent infection. I was distressed as I was kept alone (with the no visitor rule) and was nervous in general during the pandemic. All I could hear is irritating beeping machine. I didn’t have any idea when I was going to be dismissed. 
                      <br/>
                      Later the door than swung opened and a big solid fella said “Ok I’m transferring you” with no explanation so I asked why and explained that I need to be kept in an isolated room – he responded “someone else needs the room.” He dragged my bed across the emergency floor. All I saw was a glimpse of blue curtained units as I quickly covered my face with the blanket for protection. I could hear the other patients mown in pain and a foul smell. As I was being placed into another isolated room, I heard the medical staff getting verbally abused by woman at the top of her lungs – unfortunately the sad scary reality.  
                      <br/>
                      So here I was kept again in another isolated room with ongoing beeping sounds. At this stage my partner was able to pack my overnight bag and was able to pass it to the security guard to give to me. After serval hours the doctor visited me, he apologised for the poor communication and explained that I need to take a mandatory COVID test (that he ordered hours ago) and that I would be transferred into another isolated room once a bed is available.   
                      <br/>
                      I got transferred to the COVID ward late into the evening (mind you I checked-in into emergency at lunch time). They gave me sandwiches for dinner. I find it ludicrous that cancer patients who are prone to low immunity and fevers are forced into a COVID ward despite any other signs of COVID and despite that we do self-isolate regardless, we are more at risk staying at the ward.   
                      <br/>
                      It was mentally exhausting being kept in the COVID isolation ward –  I’m sure the nurses thought I was losing it as I ate lunch and sang to my music.
                      <br/>  
                      I got my COVID negative results the next morning and waited for the bed to be available in the oncology ward. I was in better care in the oncology ward. 
                      <br/>
                      I was dismissed once my blood pressure, fever and blood results were more stable. Throughout my stay in hospital, I wasn’t able bend my right arm as the injection port had to be kept in (so difficult to spread jam on bread 😅). Sleep wasn’t much of an option with the drip given every 6-8 hours (it’s like being stuck on a flight).

                      The hair loss begin! 
                      <br/>
                      My hair started to drop out in the shower and my hair felt dead and sore – I didn’t expect it to happen this way. 
                      <br/>
                      I just wanted to shave my head off ready! My mum came the next day and help put olive oil in my hair and cut of what she could. The next day after that, while I was at Peter Mac I went to the volunteer and finally got my head shaved. I felt so much better getting it all off. 
                      <br/>
                      Ideally, I wanted to cut my hair short at an earlier stage – but you know COVID restrictions.

                      I attended the ‘Look Good Feel Better’ workshop via zoom. 🥰

                I tolerated relativity well despite a few notable issues such as feeling like ‘jetlag’, dry throat, funny in the eyes and weakness on some days. I ate well throughout though.  Some days were difficult to last long periods on the computer for work, so I just had to take it easy. Some days I had brain-fog and had a few ‘brain-fart’ moments, for example I was in the kitchen and couldn’t think of the word for ‘dish rack’, I woke up in the middle of the night and the word pop right in!
